2.subsidiary :-                
                subsidiary book is like a smaller notebook used to record specific types of transactions in detail.
                 Instead of putting all transactions directly into the main book (called the ledger), businesses use subsidiary books 
                 to organize similar transactions together.

        For example:

        All sales are recorded in the Sales Book.
        All purchases are recorded in the Purchase Book.
        Cash transactions go in the Cash Book.

        This makes it easier to manage and find details about a specific type of transaction.
        Later, the totals from these subsidiary books are posted to the ledger. It's a simple way to keep things organized!

3.Account :-
        Account in simple words is a way to record and track money-related activities. It helps keep track of:

            What comes in (like money earned or received).
            What goes out (like money spent or given away).

        Each type of activity is grouped into a specific "account" so it's easier to see where the money is going or coming from. For example:

        Cash Account: Tracks all cash transactions.

        Sales Account: Tracks money earned from selling things.

        Expense Account: Tracks money spent on things like rent, salaries, or bills.

        Accounts help businesses and individuals understand their financial situation clearly.

4.Debtor :-

        A debtor is someone who owes money to you.

        Example: If you sell goods to a customer on credit, the customer is your debtor because they have to pay you later.

5.Creditor :-

    A creditor is someone to whom you owe money.

    Example: If you buy goods from a supplier on credit, the supplier is your creditor because you have to pay them later.

In short:

    Debtor = Borrower (owes you money)
    Creditor = Lender (you owe them money)

6.discounts:

discounts are reductions in the price of goods or services. There are two common types: Trade Discount and Cash Discount.

    A. Trade Discount:-

        A trade discount is given by a seller to the buyer as an incentive for buying in bulk or for business purposes.

        It is not recorded in the books of accounts because it is deducted directly on the invoice.

        Example:

        You buy goods worth ₹10,000, and the seller offers a 10% trade discount.

        You pay ₹9,000 directly. The ₹1,000 discount is not recorded separately.

    B. Cash Discount:-

    A cash discount is given to a buyer as an incentive for paying early.

    It is recorded in the books of accounts because it is directly related to the payment.

        Example:

        You owe ₹10,000 to a supplier. If you pay within 10 days, the supplier offers a 5% cash discount.
        
        If you pay early, you give ₹9,500, and the ₹500 discount is recorded as a cash discount in your accounts.

    Key Difference:

    Trade Discount: For buying goods, not recorded in accounts.

    Cash Discount: For paying early, recorded in accounts.

7.net profit and net loss :- 

    Net Profit and Net Loss show how well a business is doing financially

    Net Profit
        Net Profit is the money left after subtracting all expenses from income.

        It means the business is making money.
        
    Formula:

    Net Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses

    Example:

    A business earns ₹50,000 and spends ₹30,000.
    Net Profit = ₹50,000 - ₹30,000 = ₹20,000.
    
    Net Loss:- 

        Net Loss happens when expenses are more than income.

        It means the business is losing money.

    Formula:

        Net Loss = Total Expenses - Total Income

    Example:

    A business earns ₹30,000 and spends ₹50,000.
    Net Loss = ₹50,000 - ₹30,000 = ₹20,000.

    Key Difference:

    Net Profit: Income > Expenses (money gained).
    Net Loss: Expenses > Income (money lost).
