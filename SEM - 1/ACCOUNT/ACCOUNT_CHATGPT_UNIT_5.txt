   [ equity ] :- 
          equity refers to the owner's share or claim on the assets of a business after all liabilities (debts) have been paid. 
          It's like the value of what the owner truly "owns" in the business.

           equity is the amount left for the owner(s) if the business sold all its assets and paid off all its debts. Let me know if you'd like more examples!

           Also Known As: Net worth, owner's capital, or shareholder's equity (for companies).

           Formula for Equity:

                Equity = Assets − Liabilities

                Assets: What the business owns (e.g., cash, property, inventory).

                Liabilities: What the business owes (e.g., loans, creditors).

                Example:
                        Your business has ₹10,00,000 in assets (cash, equipment, etc.).

                        It owes ₹4,00,000 in liabilities (loans, bills, etc.).

                        Equity = ₹10,00,000 - ₹4,00,000 = ₹6,00,000.

                This ₹6,00,000 is the owner's equity—what belongs to the owner(s) of the business.

3.=>  contingent :- 
        A contingent liability is a possible financial obligation that may or may not happen in the future, depending on certain events.
        It is not an actual liability right now but something that could become one if certain conditions are met.

        simpl word :- A contingent liability is like saying, "I might have to pay this, but only if something specific happens."

4.=> provisions and reserves
        provisions and reserves are both ways to set aside money, but they serve different purposes. Let’s break it down simply

        Provisions:
                Provisions are money set aside for specific future expenses or losses that are expected to happen.
                These are based on known or likely obligations.

        Reserves:
                Reserves are money set aside from profits for general purposes or to strengthen the financial position of the business.
                These are not for specific expenses but for future needs or emergencies.

                Easy Way to Remember:
                        Provisions = Money set aside for known problems (e.g., bad debts, repairs).
                        Reserves = Money set aside for general safety or growth (e.g., future expansion, emergencies).
