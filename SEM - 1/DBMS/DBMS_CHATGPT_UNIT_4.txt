1.=> What is NoSQL, and how does it differ from traditional RDBMS? in simple word 

NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL." It refers to databases that are designed to handle a wide variety of data types and structures, unlike traditional
Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), which use a structured, table-based format with fixed rows and columns.

| Feature               | NoSQL                                                   | RDBMS                                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|                       |                                                         |                                           |                                                                            
| Data Model            | Flexible, unstructured (documents,key-value,graph,etc.) | Structured (tables with rows and columns) |
|                       |                                                         |                                           |
| Schema                | No fixed schema; data structure can vary dynamically    | Requires a predefined schema              |
|                       |                                                         |                                           |
| Scalability           | Easily scales horizontally (adding more servers)        | Typically scales vertically               |
|                       |                                                         |                                           |
| Data Handling         | Handles large, unstructured, or semi-structured data    | Best for structured, transactional data   |
|                       |                                                         |                                           |
| Query Language        | No standard query language (MongoDB , Cassandra )       | Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)      |
|                       |                                                         |                                           |
| Use Case              | Real-time analytics, big data, IoT, etc.                | Financial systems, inventory management,  |

3.	What are the different types of NoSQL databases (Key-Value, Document, Column-family, Graph)? Provide examples.

NoSQL databases come in four main types, each designed for specific use cases. Here's a simple breakdown:

    1. Key-Value Databases

        How it works: Stores data as a key-value pair (like a dictionary).

        Best for: Simple data retrieval, caching, and session management.

        Examples: Redis, DynamoDB.

    2. Document Databases

        How it works: Stores data as documents (usually JSON or BSON). Each document can have its own structure.

        Best for: Storing and managing semi-structured data like user profiles or logs.

        Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.

    3. Column-Family Databases

        How it works: Data is stored in rows and columns, but columns are grouped into families for better performance.

        Best for: Handling large amounts of structured data, analytics, or time-series data.

        Examples: Cassandra, HBase.

    4. Graph Databases

        How it works: Represents data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships).

        Best for: Social networks, recommendation systems, or fraud detection.

        Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.

        Each type of NoSQL database is specialized for particular kinds of data and queries, making them versatile for modern applications.

4.	In what scenarios should NoSQL databases be used over RDBMS
NoSQL databases are better than RDBMS in certain situations, especially when dealing with modern, large-scale applications. Here are some scenarios where NoSQL is a good choice:

    1. Handling Big Data

        Why: NoSQL databases can handle massive amounts of data more efficiently than RDBMS.

        Example: Storing logs, IoT sensor data, or user activity for platforms like social media.

    2. Flexible or Dynamic Data Structures

        Why: NoSQL doesn’t require a fixed schema, so it’s great for data that evolves over time or has varying formats.

        Example: Applications where user profiles or product details have different fields.

    3. High Scalability Needs

        Why: NoSQL scales horizontally by adding more servers, while RDBMS struggles with this.

        Example: Cloud applications with millions of users, like e-commerce or video streaming platforms.

    4. Low-Latency and Real-Time Applications

        Why: NoSQL databases like Redis offer super-fast reads and writes.

        Example: Real-time chat apps, gaming leaderboards, or caching systems.

    5. Graph-Based or Relationship-Heavy Data

        Why: Graph databases in NoSQL are optimized for managing complex relationships.

        Example: Social networks, recommendation engines, or fraud detection systems.

    6. Cost-Effectiveness for Large-Scale Systems

        Why: Scaling NoSQL is cheaper because it uses clusters of commodity hardware.

        Example: Startups or companies managing large datasets on a budget.

        In summary, use NoSQL when you need flexibility, scalability, or when dealing with unstructured, real-time, or high-volume data.

* what is mongoDB
    MongoDB is a NoSQL database designed to store and manage data in a flexible and efficient way.
    Instead of using tables like traditional databases, MongoDB stores data as documents in a format similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
    
    In short, MongoDB is flexible, fast, and perfect for modern applications that need to handle changing and complex data.
